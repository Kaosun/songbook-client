Instruction pour le build du songbook-client sur mac.

project compilation on mac need Qt to be build from souce.
Downloable Qt framework are made to work with Objective-C, not C/C++ directly.

You need to have Cmake installed.

An option is to have the Sparkle framwork in /Library/Framework.if it's the case, the application is build with support for autoupdate

There might pe a dependency to libarchive (macport ?)

Be carefull not to have a QT4 version installed through macport.
otherwise you **should imperatively** check that `which qmake` does not
point to the macport version !

If it is the case, Remove All occurence of /opt/* from your path before ever
running (C)Make, or it will cache the Library location !


The "./configure" step is directly handled by Cmake. 

$ make
sould be sufficient to have a working application created in the "build" subdirectory

there is no Xcode project.
The application have only been tested on OS X 10.6.x


Ne pas oublier de faire une fois la compilation réussie.
	changer le numero de version 
	Vérifier la présenc de la clé publique dans contents ressources

	...creer le dmg..

	monter le dmg, 
	verifier le background

	generer la signture, la mettre dans le fichier appcast, uploader le tout
